To overcome lack of trust, individuals within a group need to feel safe enough to expose their vulnerabilities
Trust is fundamental when building groups/organisations
Trust means I can give you this task and trust that you'll handle it
Trust also means I can tell you about something I'm not proud of and accept your reaction; which implies I must believe you'll not ridicue or belittle me(much) and intend to help me overcome any obstacles on the way
Actions of individuals in a group should have a common goal, which is to make the group function better. This means a group should have an actionable/achievable goal they strive to.
Politiccs is when people take actions based on how they want others to react instead on the intent to express what they think/feel
In order to change the process, there needs to be a honest resistance to it
Teamwork ultimately comes down to having a small set of principles and practicing them over long period of time
Embrace common sense with uncommon levels of discipline and persistence. Acknowledge imperfection
Five dysfunctions of a team:
- dysfunction
  - result
  - properties of the opposite of dysfunction
- lack of trust
  - results in invulnerability
  - trust is the confidence among team members that their peers intentions are good and that there's no reason to act protective
  - to allow for trust to happen, team members ought expose their vulnerabilities(skill deficiencies, mistakes, weaknesses) to peers and see whether they'll attack or coexist
  - team leader should do it first to show it's ok
- fear of conflict
  - results in artificial harmony
  - conflict can be productive although teams avoid it
  - passionate debates seeded in facts are essential for any great team
  - the purpose of a conflict is to produce the best possible solution in the shortest period of time
  - unresolved issue will pop up again(if it's important)
  - after resolving conflict team can confidently commit to decision and assume it's the best that they've got
  - team leader should watch for the tendency of being overprotective. Instead, allow team members to develop their own coping skills for dealing with conflict
- lack of commitment
  - results in ambiguity
  - commitment is a function of clarity and buy-in
  - for a consensus to happen, team members must be sure that their opinions have been at least considered
  - a decision is better than no decision. it's better to know you're wrong than don't know at all
  - team leader should be comfortable with the prospect of making a wrong decision
- avoidance of accountability
  - results low standards
  - accountability refers to the willingness of team members to call out peers on behaviors that might hurt the team
  - calling out people on their bad behavior means discomfort; one has to value the good of one's team more than being comfortable
  - the most effective and efficient means of maintaining high standards of performance on a team is peer pressure. there's nothing like the fear of letting down respected teammate that motivates people to improve their performance
  - a team that hold one another accountable avoids bureaucracy around performance management & identify potential problems by questioning one another's approaches without hesitation
  - team leader encourages members to serve as the primary accountability mechanism
  - absence of accountability mechanism is an invitation to team members to shift their attention to areas other than collective results
- inattention to results
  - results in increase of status and ego
  - behaviors & actions that contribute to team results should be rewarded
  - team leader should set a tone for the results, but be selfless and objective, and reserve rewards for those who make real contributions to the group goals

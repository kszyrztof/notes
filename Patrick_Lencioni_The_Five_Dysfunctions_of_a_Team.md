To overcome lack of trust, individuals within a group need to feel safe enough to expose their vulnerabilities
Trust is fundamental when building groups/organisations
Trust means I can give you this task and trust that you'll handle it
Trust also means I can tell you about something I'm not proud of and accept your reaction; which implies I must believe you'll not ridicue or belittle me(much) and intend to help me overcome any obstacles on the way
Actions of individuals in a group should have a common goal, which is to make the group function better. This means a group should have an actionable/achievable goal they strive to.
Politiccs is when people take actions based on how they want others to react instead on the intent to express what they think/feel
In order to change the process, there needs to be a honest resistance to it
Five dysfunctions of a team:
- dysfunction
  - result
  - properties of the opposite of dysfunction
- lack of trust
  - results in invulnerability
  - trust is the confidence among team members that their peers intentions are good and that there's no reason to act protective
  - to allow for trust to happen, team members ought expose their vulnerabilities(skill deficiencies, mistakes, weaknesses) to peers and see whether they'll attack or coexist
  - team leader should do it first to show it's ok
- fear of conflict
  - results in artificial harmony
  - conflict can be productive although teams avoid it
  - passionate debates seeded in facts are essential for any great team
  - the purpose of a conflict is to produce the best possible solution in the shortest period of time
  - unresolved issue will pop up again(if it's important)
  - after resolving conflict team can confidently commit to decision and assume it's the best that they've got
  - team leader should watch for the tendency of being overprotective. Instead, allow team members to develop their own coping skills for dealing with conflict
- lack of commitment
  - results in ambiguity
- avoidance of accountability
  - results low standards

To overcome lack of trust, individuals within a group need to feel safe enough to expose their vulnerabilities
Trust is fundamental when building groups/organisations
Trust means I can give you this task and trust that you'll handle it
Trust also means I can tell you about something I'm not proud of and accept your reaction; which implies I must believe you'll not ridicue or belittle me(much) and intend to help me overcome any obstacles on the way
Actions of individuals in a group should have a common goal, which is to make the group function better. This means a group should have an actionable/achievable goal they strive to.
Politiccs is when people take actions based on how they want others to react instead on the intent to express what they think/feel
In order to change the process, there needs to be a honest resistance to it
